package bungieapigo

// Defines an "Objective".
// An objective is a specific task you should accomplish in the game. These are referred to by:
// - Quest Steps (which are DestinyInventoryItemDefinition entities with Objectives)
// - Challenges (which are Objectives defined on an DestinyActivityDefintion)
// - Milestones (which refer to Objectives that are defined on both Quest Steps and Activities)
// - Anything else that the designers decide to do later.
// Objectives have progress, a notion of having been Completed, human readable data describing
// the task to be accomplished, and a lot of optional tack-on data that can enhance the information
// provided about the task.
type DestinyObjectiveDefinition struct {

	// Ideally, this should tell you what your task is. I'm not going to lie to you though. Sometimes
	// this doesn't have useful information at all. Which sucks, but there's nothing either of us can
	// do about it.
	DisplayProperties DestinyDisplayPropertiesDefinition `json:"displayProperties"`

	// The value that the unlock value defined in unlockValueHash must reach in order for the
	// objective to be considered Completed. Used in calculating progress and completion status.
	CompletionValue int `json:"completionValue"`

	// A shortcut for determining the most restrictive gating that this Objective is set to use. This
	// includes both the dynamic determination of progress and of completion values. See the
	// DestinyGatingScope enum's documentation for more details.
	Scope DestinyGatingScope `json:"scope"`

	// OPTIONAL: a hash identifier for the location at which this objective must be accomplished, if
	// there is a location defined. Look up the DestinyLocationDefinition for this hash for that
	// additional location info.
	LocationHash int `json:"locationHash"`

	// If true, the value is allowed to go negative.
	AllowNegativeValue bool `json:"allowNegativeValue"`

	// If true, you can effectively "un-complete" this objective if you lose progress after crossing
	// the completion threshold.
	// If False, once you complete the task it will remain completed forever by locking the value.
	AllowValueChangeWhenCompleted bool `json:"allowValueChangeWhenCompleted"`

	// If true, completion means having an unlock value less than or equal to the completionValue.
	// If False, completion means having an unlock value greater than or equal to the
	// completionValue.
	IsCountingDownward bool `json:"isCountingDownward"`

	// The UI style applied to the objective. It's an enum, take a look at DestinyUnlockValueUIStyle
	// for details of the possible styles. Use this info as you wish to customize your UI.
	// DEPRECATED: This is no longer populated by Destiny 2 game content. Please use
	// inProgressValueStyle and completedValueStyle instead.
	ValueStyle DestinyUnlockValueUIStyle `json:"valueStyle"`

	// Text to describe the progress bar.
	ProgressDescription string `json:"progressDescription"`

	// If this objective enables Perks intrinsically, the conditions for that enabling are defined
	// here.
	Perks DestinyObjectivePerkEntryDefinition `json:"perks"`

	// If this objective enables modifications on a player's stats intrinsically, the conditions
	// are defined here.
	Stats DestinyObjectiveStatEntryDefinition `json:"stats"`

	// If nonzero, this is the minimum value at which the objective's progression should be shown.
	// Otherwise, don't show it yet.
	MinimumVisibilityThreshold int `json:"minimumVisibilityThreshold"`

	// If True, the progress will continue even beyond the point where the objective met its minimum
	// completion requirements. Your UI will have to accommodate it.
	AllowOvercompletion bool `json:"allowOvercompletion"`

	// If True, you should continue showing the progression value in the UI after it's complete. I
	// mean, we already do that in BNet anyways, but if you want to be better behaved than us you could
	// honor this flag.
	ShowValueOnComplete bool `json:"showValueOnComplete"`

	// The style to use when the objective is completed.
	CompletedValueStyle DestinyUnlockValueUIStyle `json:"completedValueStyle"`

	// The style to use when the objective is still in progress.
	InProgressValueStyle DestinyUnlockValueUIStyle `json:"inProgressValueStyle"`

	// Objectives can have arbitrary UI-defined identifiers that define the style applied to
	// objectives. For convenience, known UI labels will be defined in the uiStyle enum value.
	UiLabel string `json:"uiLabel"`

	// If the objective has a known UI label value, this property will represent it.
	UiStyle DestinyObjectiveUiStyle `json:"uiStyle"`

	// The unique identifier for this entity. Guaranteed to be unique for the type of entity, but not
	// globally.
	// When entities refer to each other in Destiny content, it is this hash that they are referring to.
	Hash int `json:"hash"`

	// The index of the entity as it was found in the investment tables.
	Index int `json:"index"`

	// If this is true, then there is an entity with this identifier/type combination, but BNet is not
	// yet allowed to show it. Sorry!
	Redacted bool `json:"redacted"`
