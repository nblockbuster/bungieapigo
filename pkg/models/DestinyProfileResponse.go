	// Do you ever get the feeling that a system was designed *too* flexibly? That it can be used in so
	// many different ways that you end up being unable to provide an easy to use abstraction for the
	// mess that's happening under the surface?
	// Let's talk about character-specific data that might be related to items without instances.
	// These two statements are totally unrelated, I promise.
	// At some point during D2, it was decided that items - such as Bounties - could be given to
	// characters and *not* have instance data, but that *could* display and even use relevant state
	// information on your account and character.
	// Up to now, any item that had meaningful dependencies on character or account state had to be
	// instanced, and thus "itemComponents" was all that you needed: it was keyed by item's instance
	// IDs and provided the stateful information you needed inside.
	// Unfortunately, we don't live in such a magical world anymore. This is information held on a
	// per-character basis about non-instanced items that the characters have in their inventory -
	// or that reference character-specific state information even if it's in Account-level
	// inventory - and the values related to that item's state in relation to the given character.
	// To give a concrete example, look at a Moments of Triumph bounty. They exist in a character's
	// inventory, and show/care about a character's progression toward completing the bounty. But
	// the bounty itself is a non-instanced item, like a mod or a currency. This returns that data for
	// the characters who have the bounty in their inventory.
	// I'm not crying, you're crying Okay we're both crying but it's going to be okay I promise Actually
	// I shouldn't promise that, I don't know if it's going to be okay
